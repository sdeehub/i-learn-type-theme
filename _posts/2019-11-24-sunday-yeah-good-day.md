1. Intersperse the questions in Step#1 with personal anecdotes and experiences. Example: When the person is done answering "What do you do for a living?", one can start talking about what one does for a living (even if one hasn't been asked - but it pays to be mindful that one can come across as a braggart or arrogant if one doesn't employ the right finesse and skill), or tell a story (the funnier, the better) that relates to what they've just said or one's own job-related experiences.
2. Answer the question you're about to ask first - this is a way of slightly changing the form of a question or disguising it. Example: Instead of asking "What do you do for a living?," one can try: "I work in the field of equity investing. Stock investing. Though it's challenging, I break-dance to work everyday and couldn't see myself doing anything else. What do you do for work?"
3. Mix-it-up/Non-linearity. Example: Since job interviews tend to follow a linear progression toward an eventual goal (a series of questions leading to a better understanding of the candidate for the intended purpose), one can consider asking questions in a non-linear fashion (mixing up the subjects, the angles/perspectives, etc.), and one can mix one's communication with (1) on this list, pop-culture or news references, things one has learned (such as facts), jokes, and a host of other things.

As Mark Twain supposedly said, "I never learned nothing while I was doing the talking."

Next time I meet someone I think I'd like, I'm going to say, "We're not supposed to talk about politics or religion. What else do you want to talk about?" That will put the ball in the other's court.

Be creative! Be interesting! Honestly, is "what is you job" the only possible thing you can think of to say to someone? If so, you are probably a boring person. Jump right into it. Ask something ridiculous. Make up something that's completely untrue. Make an observation about something funny that's happening around you. I have started conversations by asking people to sum up their life story in three sentences. By asking them if there's something bothering them, really. I have started conversations by talking about whatever is on my mind, whatever is interesting me at the moment, or if I have a problem that I want a second opinion on. I have responded to people asking me my job by telling them I'm a pornstar, a crab fisherman, a stay at home dad. Whenever anyone asks me a boring question I either leave, ask them to try another question, or make up an absurd answer but do it with a straight face. If you are looking for unique and interesting conversations, be unique and be interesting. Stop being boring and you will end up in less boring conversations. Or if you want to be in boring conversations, keep asking people boring questions like what their job is and where they live and you will have plenty of them.

Just like in any situation, be yourself, do what you want, and you will find like-minded people.
