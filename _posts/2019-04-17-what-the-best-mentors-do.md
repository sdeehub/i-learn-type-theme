[What the best mentors do:](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/what-the-best-mentors-do)
- Put the relationship before the mentorship.
- Focus on character rather than competency.
- Shout loudly with your optimism, and keep quiet with your cynicism.
- Be more loyal to your mentee than you are to your company.
