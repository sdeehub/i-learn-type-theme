Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are.

It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, and nobody is gonna hit you as hard as life.

But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward.

That's how winning is done!

Now if you know what you're worth then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or nobody!

Cowards do that. And that ain't you. You're better than that. ~ Rocky Balboa
