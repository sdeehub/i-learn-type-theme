- Don't rush on anything. When the time is right, it'll happen.
- Don't rush the process, Good thing take time.
- Don't rush; just relax. Enjoy the journey of life. When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about it and want to get on to other things.
- Don't rush and never settle. If it's meant to be, it will be.
