A goal with no clear purpose is doomed to fail. Even if it's accomplished, you can feel incomplete still.

For Karen, she knew what she wanted -- to finish the marketing program and get some sort of certificate. It was pretty straightforward.

But, when I asked her why, she wasn't sure.

1. Why do I want to take the course?
  - So that I can improve my qualifications at marketing.
2. Why improve qualifications?
  - Because I want to take my career further and take on more leadership roles.
3. Why do I want a leadership role?
  - Because I want to take charge of a campaign from beginning to end.
4. Why can't I do that now?
  - Because I'm not proactive enough in being the point person that others follow.
5. Why is that?
  - Because I'm afraid of public speaking situations and presenting my ideas to a live audience.
