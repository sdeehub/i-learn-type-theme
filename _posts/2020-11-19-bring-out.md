Bring out the best! Bring out the best in others.
- Appraise them carefully - Appraise and evaluate them so you can equip them with what they need in order to develop.
- Model the attitude, the work ethic and the standards you want to see in others.
- Believe in their success. Believe they can succeed and show them that you want and expect them to.
- Provide feedback. Give people honest, positive feedback and to mentor and coach them. feedback should communicate empathy and caring.
- Give them power. People become strong and effective only when they are given the opportunity to make decisions, act to solve problems and meet challenges.
- Offer public praise. Tell people publicly how much confidence you have in them. As you raise people up, show them your confidence in them and you will find how quickly theyâ€™ll live up to your expectations.
- Give autonomy. Give them the skills to make decisions and succeed, then give them the autonomy to do it for themselves.
- Lead from within. When you bring out the best in others, you have an incredibly positive impact on the lives of the people you empower.
