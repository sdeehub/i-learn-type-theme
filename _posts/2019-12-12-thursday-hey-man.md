How to build a meaningful connection

- Before the event: do your research - who will be there, their backgrounds and interests
- At the event: find something you have in common - shift from a peer to someone like them > same neighborhood, same age, like dogs, same school
- At the event: learn about the person's passions - work-related, hobby
- At the event: become their wingman - maybe there's someone else at the event that you think they should meet. > make introductions, share interesting facts, shine a light on them.
