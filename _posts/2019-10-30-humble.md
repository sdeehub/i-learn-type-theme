The first thing, Is to be honest with yourself.

You can never, Have an impact,On society.

If you have not changed yourself.

And one of the most important weapons, In changing yourself, Is to recognize, That people everywhere in the world, Want peace.

But humility, Is one of the most important qualities, Which you must have.

Because if you are humble, If you make people realize, That you are no threat to them, Then people will embrace you.
