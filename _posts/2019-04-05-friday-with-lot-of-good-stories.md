Emotional Awareness - Practice: (Source: [mindful.org](https://www.mindful.org/emotional-rescue-using-mindfulness-to-reset-your-reactions/?mc_cid=8833a43868&mc_eid=a6ef769556))
1. Recognize emotions more often as they arise. Label briefly, if you like, whatever emotion you notice.
2. Refrain, for a moment, from doing whatever you typically do with that emotion. Pause, take a few breaths, and let things alone before taking a next step.
3. Relax if you can, letting go of any sense of constriction or tension the emotion causes you. If you see something useful to be done about how you feel—go for it. If not, practice letting things be, instead of falling back on reactive, less productive habits.
4. Resolve to keep working on emotional awareness and reactivity.  Old habits change slowly, not all at once.
