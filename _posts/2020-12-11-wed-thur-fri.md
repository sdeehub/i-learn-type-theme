How do we ignite the power of imagination in times of suffering? First, we must start by understanding our priorities. Begin by asking:

- What matters most to me right now? What must I hold on to or protect? From there, it is a matter of operationalizing our priorities into manageable, reasonable next steps.
- What is possible in this moment? Possible is different than desirable; it is not tied to outcomes but to one’s inner ability to choose.
- What choices do I have right now?
- How do my choices tie to what matters most? Sounds simple, but from the depths of suffering even the smallest choices feel monumental.

While we can’t imagine suffering away, we can imagine space within suffering for other occurrences—laughter, connection, compassion.
