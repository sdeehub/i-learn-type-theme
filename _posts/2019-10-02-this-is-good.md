As Hotel Front Desk Supervisor, I would recommend the following:

1. Even if it isn’t, tell the clerk you’re on a honeymoon, vacation, or here for a special occasion. It’s more common for people to offer a complimentary upgrade without the guest asking directly. Directly asking for an upgrade without stating a reason gives the clerk a vibe that you’re going to be ‘high maintenence’.
2. Don’t book via third party websites. They can be misleading and end up booking you in the wrong location, different hotel on that property, etc. They will fool you by having a better rate. If they do, I would be hesitant about booking it. Cancellations are also more difficult as the guest typically must go through the booking agency directly rather than the hotel.
3. Pick a slower day. Slower days where our occupancy is low, we almost always upgrade guests if they ask. Mostly just because we don’t have to worry about giving away someone else’s room on those days. (Multi-night reservations are usually a different story, however, due to availability being a day-to-day basis. Hotels typically have way more standard rooms than suites. They wouldn’t want to overbook themselves on a suite versus a standard room.)
4. Tell the clerk it’s your first time there. If they’re doing their job correctly, they’ll have a more open attitude about suggestions, rewards, complimentary offers, etc.
5. Ask what discounts they offer. Most hotels offer military, AAA, AARP, first responders, government, and corporate rates for business trips. It doesn’t hurt to ask and always ask before they check you in. This will reduce your risk of being overcharged after the discount is applied.
6. My last suggestion is to just be extra polite as it is a customer service industry. Larger scale hotel employees deal with a lot of hostility at times and are used to it. However, if you’re nice and friendly about what you’re asking for, they’ll want to be more helpful and may end up giving you things complimentary just because of your kindness.
