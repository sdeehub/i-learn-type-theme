Winners don't make excuses!

<i class="fa fa-child" style="color:plum"></i>

You got to look at the reality of the situation... You kind of got to get over yourself.

It's not about you man.

OK, You feel embarrassed, You're not that important,

Like, Get over yourself.

Right, Like you're worried, About how people may perceive you,

And like,

You're walking around, And it's embarrassing, Because you shot five air balls.

Get over yourself, right?

And so after that it's, "OK, well why did those airballs happen?"

Got it.

High school, Year before we played 35 games max.

Week in between, Spaced out, Plenty of time to rest.

In the NBA, It's back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back, I didn't have the legs.

So you look at the shot, Every shot was on line, But every shot was short.

I got to get stronger. I got to train differently.

The weight training program that I'm doing, I got to tailor it for an 82 game season,

So when the playoffs come around, My legs are stronger, And that ball gets there.

So I look at it with rationale, And say,

"OK, Well the reason I shot an airball, Is because my legs aren't there, ... next year they'll be there."

That was it. ~ Kobe Bryant
